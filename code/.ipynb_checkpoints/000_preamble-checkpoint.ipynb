    "These readability tests are used extensively in the field of education. The \"Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level Formula\" presents a score as a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. It can also mean the number of years of education generally required to understand this text, relevant when the formula results in a number greater than 10. The grade level is calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0.39\\left(\\frac{\\text { total words }}{\\text { total sentences }}\\right)+11.8\\left(\\frac{\\text { total syllables }}{\\text { total words }}\\right)-15.59\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a number that corresponds with a U.S. grade level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The lowest grade level score in theory is −3.40.\n",
